### Channel State Information Auto-Labeling System for Large-scale Deep Learning-based Wi-Fi Sensing

> **Abstract:** *Wi-Fi Sensing, which uses Wi-Fi technology to sense the surrounding environments, 
> has strong potentials in a variety of sensing applications. Recently several advanced deep learning-based 
> solutions using CSI (Channel State Information) data have achieved high performance, 
> but it is still difficult to use in practice without explicit data collection, 
> which requires expensive adaptation efforts for model retraining. In this study, 
> we propose a Channel State Information Automatic Labeling System (CALS) that automatically 
> collects and labels training CSI data for deep learning-based Wi-Fi sensing systems. 
> The proposed system allows the CSI data collection process to efficiently collect labeled 
> CSI for labeling for supervised learning using computer vision technologies such as object detection algorithms. 
> We built a prototype of CALS to demonstrate its efficiency and collected data to train deep learning models 
> for detecting the presence of a person in an indoor environment, showing to achieve an accuracy of over 90% 
> with the auto-labeled data sets generated by CALS.*

There are two versions included: a demo version that works with pre-extracted CSI data in CSV format, 
and a database version that collects CSI data directly from the Raspberry Pi extractor and stores it in a MySQL database
for further process.
